# CSCI3250+3251 Project Team E #
## Introduction ##

This repo is building a page in [this page](https://csci3250-2019.github.io/projrct-team-e). We are going to try out the [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and build a page using it. We are going to try using the project management function of GitHub here as well. There will also be a C program written by us pushed to here as well.

## Code ##
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
  return 0;
}
```
